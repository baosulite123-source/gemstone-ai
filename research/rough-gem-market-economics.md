## 3. Current Rough Gem Grading & Sorting

### The Manual Grading Process

Rough gemstone grading remains **overwhelmingly manual** and relies on expert human judgment. There is no universally standardized grading system for rough colored stones comparable to the GIA diamond grading system.

#### Key Parameters Assessed
1. **Color** — Hue, saturation, tone (assessed visually under standardized lighting)
2. **Clarity** — Inclusions visible to naked eye or loupe; internal fractures, silk, crystals
3. **Shape/Crystal Form** — Affects cutting yield potential
4. **Size (Weight)** — Measured in carats
5. **Transparency** — Transparent, translucent, opaque
6. **Treatment Potential** — Whether heat treatment could improve color/clarity
7. **Origin Indicators** — Crystal habit, inclusions suggesting geographic origin

#### How Sorting Works in Practice

**At the mine level:**
- Rough is washed, sorted into broad categories (gem-grade, near-gem, industrial).
- Initial sorting by size using sieves (calibrated mesh screens).
- Color sorting done by eye under daylight or standardized lighting.
- Speed: An experienced sorter can process **200–500 stones per hour** for basic categorization.

**At trading hubs (Bangkok, Colombo):**
- Expert dealers ("sorters" or "assorters") examine individual stones.
- Each stone is assessed for color, clarity, shape, and cutting potential.
- Stones are grouped into "lots" of similar quality for sale.
- Speed: Detailed individual assessment takes **2–5 minutes per stone** for an expert.
- A skilled sorter might evaluate **100–200 stones per day** at full detail.

**Formal auction preparation (e.g., Gemfields):**
- Rough is sorted into lots by gemologists over weeks/months.
- Lots are categorized into defined quality tiers (e.g., Gemfields uses ~60+ quality grades for rough ruby).
- Photography, weighing, and documentation for each lot.
- The process from mine to auction-ready can take **3–6 months**.

### Costs of Manual Grading

| Cost Component | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Expert gemologist salary (Bangkok) | $2,000–5,000/month |
| Expert gemologist salary (Africa/Sri Lanka) | $500–2,000/month |
| Senior assorter (decades of experience) | $5,000–15,000/month |
| Cost per stone (detailed assessment) | $0.50–5.00 depending on volume |
| Cost per lot (auction preparation) | $50–500+ per lot |
| Training time to become competent | 5–10 years of apprenticeship |
| Equipment (lighting, loupes, basic instruments) | $500–2,000 per station |

### Limitations of Manual Grading

- **Subjectivity:** Two experts can disagree on color grade or quality tier, especially for borderline stones. Studies suggest **15–30% disagreement rates** on color grading between experienced gemologists.
- **Fatigue:** Accuracy degrades after 4–6 hours of continuous sorting.
- **Inconsistency:** Grading can vary by time of day, lighting conditions, and sorter fatigue.
- **Bottleneck:** The scarcity of truly expert sorters limits throughput.
- **Bias:** Sorters may unconsciously bias toward expected origin-quality correlations.
- **No data capture:** Manual sorting generates minimal structured data for analytics.

## 4. Price Ranges by Quality Tier

### Rough Ruby Price Ranges (per carat, approximate)

| Quality Tier | Description | Price Range (USD/ct) |
|---|---|---|
| **Exceptional / Pigeon Blood** | Vivid red, eye-clean, good crystal form, 2+ ct, Mogok origin | $1,000–10,000+ |
| **Fine** | Strong red, slightly included, good shape, any origin | $200–1,000 |
| **Good Commercial** | Medium red, moderate inclusions, cuttable | $50–200 |
| **Commercial** | Pinkish-red or dark red, included, smaller sizes | $5–50 |
| **Low Commercial** | Heavily included, poor color, still cuttable | $1–5 |
| **Near-Gem / Cabochon Grade** | Translucent, heavy inclusions, for cabs or beads | $0.10–1.00 |
| **Industrial / Reject** | Opaque, fractured, non-gem | $0.01–0.10 |

**Note:** Unheated rough of fine quality from Mogok commands extreme premiums. A single exceptional unheated Mogok ruby rough can sell for $50,000–100,000+ per carat at auction.

### Rough Blue Sapphire Price Ranges (per carat, approximate)

| Quality Tier | Description | Price Range (USD/ct) |
|---|---|---|
| **Exceptional / Royal Blue** | Vivid cornflower/royal blue, eye-clean, 3+ ct, Kashmir/Ceylon | $500–5,000+ |
| **Fine** | Strong blue, slightly included, good shape | $100–500 |
| **Good Commercial** | Medium blue, moderate inclusions | $20–100 |
| **Commercial** | Light/dark blue, included, smaller sizes | $3–20 |
| **Low Commercial** | Very light or very dark, heavily included | $0.50–3.00 |
| **Near-Gem / Cabochon Grade** | Translucent, for star sapphires or cabs | $0.10–0.50 |
| **Heating Feedstock** | Poor color but responds well to heat treatment | $1–10 |

**Note:** Kashmir sapphires (virtually no current production) command astronomical prices. Unheated Ceylon sapphires of fine quality are the benchmark for premium pricing.

### Price Multiplier Effects

- **Origin premium:** Mogok ruby vs. Mozambique ruby of comparable quality: **2–5x**
- **Unheated premium:** Unheated vs. heated (comparable quality): **2–10x**
- **Size premium:** Price per carat escalates exponentially above 2ct for ruby and 3ct for sapphire.
- **Cut yield impact:** A rough stone graded correctly for optimal cutting orientation can yield a finished stone worth **30–100% more** than one cut sub-optimally.

## 5. The Economic Case for AI Automation in Rough Gem Grading

### 5.1 Cost Savings from Faster/More Accurate Grading

**Speed improvement:**
- Manual detailed grading: **100–200 stones/day** per expert
- AI-assisted grading (imaging + ML): Potential **1,000–5,000+ stones/day** per station
- **5–25x throughput improvement**, reducing labor costs per stone by 80–95%

**Direct labor savings:**
- A medium-scale operation sorting 10,000 stones/month currently requires 3–5 expert sorters
- With AI: 1 operator + AI system could handle the same volume
- Annual labor savings: **$100,000–300,000** per operation
- For a large operation (Gemfields scale, millions of carats/year): **$1–5 million** annually

**Accuracy improvement:**
- Eliminating subjective disagreement (15–30% of borderline decisions) reduces pricing errors
- Consistent grading under standardized conditions 24/7
- Machine learning models trained on thousands of expert-graded examples can match or exceed average human accuracy for color grading

### 5.2 Reduced Losses from Misgrading

**The misgrading problem:**
- Misgrading a rough stone by one quality tier can mean a **20–50% pricing error**
- On a parcel of 1,000 stones averaging $50/ct (10ct average), a 5% misgrading rate affecting 50 stones with an average $25/stone error = **$1,250 loss per parcel**
- Scaled across annual volumes of millions of carats: **$500,000–5,000,000** in annual value leakage from misgrading

**Specific misgrading risks:**
- **Color under-grading:** Selling a fine stone in a commercial lot (loss: $100–500+ per stone)
- **Color over-grading:** Overpaying at auction for stones that don't meet expectations (loss: 20–40% of purchase price)
- **Missing treatment potential:** Not identifying stones that would dramatically improve with heat treatment (loss: 2–5x value)
- **Incorrect origin attribution:** Missing indicators that suggest premium origin (loss: 2–10x value premium)

**AI mitigation:**
- Consistent, data-driven classification reduces misgrading rate from ~15–30% to potentially **3–5%**
- Estimated value recovery: **2–10%** of total rough parcel value through better classification
- For a $10M annual rough purchasing operation: **$200,000–1,000,000** in recovered value

### 5.3 Improved Cutting Yield Value

**The cutting optimization opportunity:**

This is potentially the **single largest economic benefit** of AI in rough gem processing.

- Rough-to-cut weight retention: typically **30–50%**
- But **value retention** is what matters — a well-oriented cut can yield a stone worth 3–5x more than a poorly oriented cut of the same rough
- Key factors AI can optimize:
  - **Color zoning analysis:** Identifying optimal orientation to maximize face-up color
  - **Inclusion mapping:** 3D scanning to plan cuts that avoid or minimize visible inclusions
  - **Shape optimization:** Recommending optimal cut shape (oval, cushion, round, etc.) for maximum value
  - **Weight retention vs. quality trade-off:** Calculating whether a larger, slightly included stone is worth more than a smaller, cleaner one

**Value impact:**
- Studies in diamond cutting (where AI is more advanced) show **10–15% improvement** in yield value through optimized planning
- For colored stones, the potential is even larger due to greater color/inclusion complexity
- On a $50M annual cutting operation, a 10% yield improvement = **$5M additional value**
- Even a conservative 5% improvement on a small operation ($5M/year) = **$250,000** additional value

### 5.4 Scalability Advantages

**Human expert scarcity:**
- Truly skilled rough gem sorters require 5–10 years of training
- The global supply of expert rough ruby/sapphire sorters is estimated at only **a few hundred** individuals
- New deposit discoveries (like Montepuez in 2009) create sudden demand spikes for sorting expertise
- Expert knowledge is tacit and lost when individuals retire or leave the industry

**AI scalability:**
- Once trained, an AI model can be **deployed to any location** with cameras and computers
- New sorting stations can be added at marginal cost of hardware (~$5,000–20,000 per station)
- Models can be continuously improved with new data
- Knowledge is **preserved and transferable** — no risk of expertise loss
- Can operate **24/7** without fatigue degradation
- Can be deployed at **mine sites** (reducing need to transport rough to trading hubs)

**Data network effects:**
- Each stone graded by AI adds to the training dataset
- Models improve over time, creating a **compounding advantage**
- Cross-deposit learning: Patterns from one mine can inform grading at another
- Market intelligence: Aggregate grading data enables better pricing and demand forecasting

### 5.5 Summary: ROI Estimate for AI Grading System

| Benefit Category | Annual Value (Medium Operation) | Annual Value (Large Operation) |
|---|---|---|
| Labor cost savings | $100,000–300,000 | $1,000,000–5,000,000 |
| Reduced misgrading losses | $200,000–500,000 | $1,000,000–5,000,000 |

| Speed/throughput gains | $50,000–200,000 | $500,000–2,000,000 |
| **Total annual benefit** | **$600,000–2,000,000** | **$5,000,000–22,000,000** |

**Estimated system costs:**
- Development: $500,000–2,000,000 (one-time, for training data collection + model development)
- Hardware per station: $10,000–50,000 (cameras, lighting, computing)
- Annual maintenance/improvement: $100,000–300,000
- **Payback period: 6–18 months** for a medium operation, **3–6 months** for large operations
